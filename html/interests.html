	In the past 1 ½ years since I moved to Edmonds, I have picked up a few new interests. Since December 2018, I started getting into fitness and nutrition.<br/>
	I don’t remember the exact moment of how it sparked my interest, as I was never an athletic person. But I do know that my goals and ideas for fitness and<br/>
	nutrition have been constantly evolving ever since I started. I mainly enjoy weight training of most muscle groups and I recently picked up hiking.<br/>
	I am on the constant lookout for superfoods and supplements/vitamins to accompany me in my journey. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Other than health and fitness related tasks, you can find me playing video games on my computer very often. As a kid, I grew up with an older brother and dad<br/>
	that loved their share of video games. As a result, I ended up loving them as well. I went from playing the SNES, Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, GameCube, PlayStation<br/>
	Consoles, Xbox consoles, to now PC Gaming. I enjoy a wide variety of games, but the ones I play the most are probably of the action/shooter genre.<br/> 
	Below this you will find some links to some of my favorite things.
