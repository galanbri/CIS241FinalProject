	After taking a break from school, I really looked forward to coming back. This was mainly because I had an idea of what I wanted to do this time<br/>
	I was both excited but a little anxious finally start studying Web Development. I honestly didn't look into Web Development as much as I felt others did<br/>
	before deciding to pursue it. All the experience I had was from my Introduction to Computer Informations Course. However, I did look forward to Web Development I<br/>
	the most. I enjoyed learning how to incorporate design elements into a Web Page, which I did not learn in my introduction course. I really appreciated the textbook<br/>
	being online because it allowed me to access the textbook through my phone, which made reading chapters a lot more convenient. I also really like that the textbook<br/>
	provided a lot of study tools, suchs the pre-assessments, post-assessments, and practice tests. I find that creating clean and easy-to-read code was a lot more<br/>
	difficult than I thought it was. I would often find myself confused on where I went wrong, and then finally find the problem way later. I will try to best to improve <br/>
	as I take more coding classes.
